## Project Overview

Swift is a lightweight, and highly functional quadruped robot that can be used for educational purposes, research, or as a stepping stone to more advanced robotics projects. The design combines 3D-printed components, off-the-shelf electronics, and custom firmware to create a versatile and customizable robot.

### Key Features
- Fully 3D-printed body and limb components
- Modular design for easy assembly and customization
- Controlled via ESP32-S3 microcontroller
- Support for advanced gait algorithms and inverse kinematics
- Open-source
